A few things to keep in mind:
•               We like functional paradigms like having limited side effects, to the extent possible in Ruby
•               Make the code as clean as you would make it if you were submitting it for actual code review while working here (documentation, testing, etc.)
•               That website has some test cases, but they are not complete so please ensure your answer is accurate independently
•               Please include documentation explaining your overall approach
•               It's fine to include standard gems
•               I'm confident that you can create a solution which works – our goal with this challenge is more to understand the way you approach problems rather than to verify you are able to solve this particular one. I would much rather have you take an extra week and submit something clean than do a quick-and-dirty job, so take all the time you need.

**todo**
* Use meaningful method names -- e.g., NOT "s" 
* see todos 
* strings single quote -- unless interpolate
*  protected_class_method
* change all procs to lambdas https://stackoverflow.com/questions/626/when-to-use-lambda-when-to-use-proc-new
